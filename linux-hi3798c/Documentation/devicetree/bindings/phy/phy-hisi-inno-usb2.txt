HiSilicon INNO USB2 PHY

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following strings:
	"hisilicon,inno-usb2-phy",
	"hisilicon,hi3798cv200-usb2-phy".
- reg: Should be the address space for INNO USB 2.0 PHY configuration register
  in peripheral controller, e.g. PERI_USB0 on Hi3798CV200 SoC.
- #phy-cells: Should be 1. The specifier is the index of the PHY port to
  reference.
- clocks: The phandle and clock specifier pair for reference clock utmi_refclk.
- resets: The list of phandle and reset specifier pairs for each reset signal
  in reset-names.
- reset-names: Should contain "power_on", "utmi0" and "utmi1". The "utmi1"
  should exist only if the device has two PHY port.

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Notes:
- The device node should be a child of peripheral controller that contains
  INNO USB 2.0 PHY configuration register used to set up PHY.

Example:

perictrl: peripheral-controller@8a20000 {
	compatible = "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-perictrl", "syscon",
		     "simple-mfd";
	reg = <0x8a20000 0x1000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges = <0x0 0x8a20000 0x1000>;

	usb2_phy1: phy@120 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-usb2-phy";
		reg = <0x120 0x4>;
		#phy-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&crg HISTB_USB2_PHY1_REF_CLK>;
		resets = <&crg 0xbc 4>,
			 <&crg 0xbc 8>,
			 <&crg 0xbc 9>;
		reset-names = "power_on", "utmi0", "utmi1";
	};

	usb2_phy2: phy@124 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-usb2-phy";
		reg = <0x124 0x4>;
		#phy-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&crg HISTB_USB2_PHY2_REF_CLK>;
		resets = <&crg 0xbc 6>,
			 <&crg 0xbc 10>;
		reset-names = "power_on", "utmi0";
	};
};
